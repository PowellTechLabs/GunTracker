Gun Tracker is a program to track handguns and long guns in case the information is needed for qualification paperwork or for homeowners insurance claims.

The program allows you to enter firearm details, including manufacturer, model, caliber, color, serial number, purchase price, current value and notes and allows you to add up to 5 photos for each weapon.

You can export the database to a .csv file or print it as a .pdf.  If you don't need the qualification details, these can be omitted from either the .csv or the .pdf 

A backup and restore option are also available.

The manufacturers include the top 20 gun manufacturers and allow you to add any that aren't in the list.  Most common calibers are also the defaults and other calibers can be added.

The database stays local to  your computer and has no internet connectivity whatsoever.
