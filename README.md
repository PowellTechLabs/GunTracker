I created this program to track all my handguns and long guns in case I needed the information for qualification paperwork or for homeowners insurance claims.  
The program allows you to enter firearm details, including manufacturer, model, caliber, color, serial number and notes and allows you to add up to 5 photos for each weapon.
You can export the database to a .csv file or print it as a .pdf
